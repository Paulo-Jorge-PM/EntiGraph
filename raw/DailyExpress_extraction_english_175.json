        "postText": "'The Liberal Democrat leader launched her party campaign ahead of the December general election pledging once again to cancel Brexit should her party win a governing majority. But as she also promised to unite the country, BBC's Laura Kuenssberg challenged the Remain leader on how she would reconcile with the 17.4 million Britons who voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum and will feel disregarded  by a Lib Dem government.', 'Ms Kuenssberg asked: You said this morning you want to bring the country together.', 'But how would you do that if your plan is to disregard the vote of millions of people in the referendum of 2016?', 'Whether that\u2019s campaigning to stop Brexit in another referendum or if you achieve your dream of a majority, revoking it all together without even having another vote?', 'The Lib Dem leader replied: As Liberal Democrats, we are standing up for what we believe in and we are very honest and straightforward about that.', 'I recognise that there are differences of opinion on this issue and I think people recognise and appreciate that we are consistent and we are firm in what we are standing for.', 'I think it\u2019s also true that there is very little reason to have confidence that there is a majority in this country for any specific Brexit path.', 'Theresa May\u2019s Brexit wasn\u2019t acceptable to Boris Johnson.', 'Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit isn\u2019t acceptable to Nigel Farage. There isn\u2019t a Brexit that commands a majority.', 'We want to stop Brexit and if we get a majority Liberal Democrat government that is exactly what we will do.', 'And we have led the campaign for a People\u2019s Vote which would put a specific Brexit deal to the public and say these are the details.', 'This is what has been negotiated, do you want to go ahead with that specific Brexit deal?', 'And I believe in those circumstances people would vote Remain because I don\u2019t think there is a majority for any specific Brexit.', 'Speaking in Westminster, Ms Swinson, who courted controversy on Monday for suggesting those refusing to debate her in TV leadership hustings were sexist, said the election could be a moment of seismic change where a new and different politics could emerge.', 'She told the audience: Change is possible and you get to choose.', 'Ms Swinson also claimed staying in the EU would produce a \u00a350billion Remain bonus that could be spent on public services.', 'She said: Any type of Brexit will damage our economy, will cost jobs and starve our public services of the resources that they need. ', ' So we know that that Remain bonus will be \u00a350billion that we can spend on our public services, investing in our schools and in the welfare system to help the poorest in our society.', 'So every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit and invest that\u00a3 50 billion in our public services.'",

I think she should be in the ITV debate, it will show once and for all, what a sham she is, because as sure as eggs are eggs, she will make a fool of herself. She had better buy herself a life belt, because the garbage scow Lib Dem will surely sink. I can 't wait to see her face when all the constituents from her new entries seats, take their revenge and consign the turncoats to the unemployment line. If she loses some of her own MPs, that will be the icing on the cake, and if La Sturgeon 's lot kick her out, then that will be the cherry we are not allowed to pick",

The facts are these: He won't get 12 MPs. The Lib Dems will easily get 12 more than they currently have. The SNP will get far more than they currently have. At least half the Conservative Party will never vote for a no deal<b>  Brexit</b> and only the BP MPs would vote for it, so it will never pass. The only relevance that the BP have is to field candidates in former Labour seats, where the electorate won't vote Labour now. Doing anything that affects Boris getting a large majority will just let Corbyn in, definitely propped up  by the  SNP and maybe the Lib Dems too, although he probably won't need them.",

The EU have bribed car manufactuers with  eu loans and handouts to LEAVE Britain and move to other EU countries , because they want to stop OUR success. The EU hounds our farmers, and use drones to watch their fields in case a few extra lambs  more than they allow   can be counted, then the farmers are fined.  These are the FACTS you should be taking into account.   The EU is BAD for Britain which ever way you look at it. We need a clean break <b> Brexit.</b>",

There are some factories which have been relocated to other EU countries with EU subsidies, such as the Kraft factory, but generally our larger manufacturers have benefitted from EU membership.BMW and Nissan would probably not be located in the UK if we were not in the EU.So leaving the EU creates a major problem for these fishermen and farmers.
